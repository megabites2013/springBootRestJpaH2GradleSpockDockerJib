== A demo springBoot 100% Rest application(stateless) with
Jpa Jwt H2 Rest SwaggerUI Hib Gradle Spock Geb Docker Jib and Groovy, etc.
Almost complete stack you might use to develop a SpringBoot Rest API

== Requirement is as below:


Write a REST service that will return the geographic (straight line) distance between two postal codes in the UK.



Result to a valid request must be a json document that contains the following information:

    For both locations, the postal code, latiude and longitude (both in degrees);

    The distance between the two locations (in kilometers);

    A fixed string 'unit' that has the value "km";

    

For postal codes lookup: use the following data.

== How to verify


test & build:
```
./gradlew build
```

run it:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

```
http://localhost:8080   -> login page, then shows a simple CRUD based on the rest APIs

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html  -> swagger2 UI, where you can test api, the api url is /api/postcodes

http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs   -> The Api yaml

http://localhost:8080/console   -> H2 mem DB console, jdbc url should be: jdbc:h2:mem:postcodes, empty sa passord
```
